<p class="small-font">I decided to do my topic due to a discussion circle my advisory had. We discussed about how students weren't fully aware of all the events going on at school. I decided to make a website because it was something I was always interested in doing, and now that I had a reason for making a website to inform, I was excited for this task. The best part of doing a website is seeing how how each line my my code would create a new visual appearance on my website. I was proud of seeing how my code looked at the end and how it turned out splendid. The biggest struggle I had was trying to make the calendar. This was hard because i did not know how to code a calendar into a website. I want people to be able to look at my website and see how they could program their own website too, I could potentially inspire people to become programmers too. Something I have learned from doing this is that I have a hidden talent of coding that i didn't know of. I could be a programmer when I grow up because it turned out to be one of the most funnest things I have ever done.</p>
